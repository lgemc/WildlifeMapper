## WildlifeMapper: Aerial Image Analysis for Multi-Species Detection and Identification

WildlifeMapper (WM) is a state-of-the-art model for detecting, locating, and identifying multiple animal species in aerial imagery. It introduces novel modules to enhance localization and identification accuracy, with a verified dataset of 11k images and 28k annotations. This repository contains code for WildlifeMapper, scripts to download and tool to visualize dataset ([**BisQue**](https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/client_service/view?resource=https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/data_service/00-TGbt6MLRm7VCn4mWmVaQsc)).

## Dataset

See [here](https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/client_service/view?resource=https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/data_service/00-TGbt6MLRm7VCn4mWmVaQsc) for an overview of the datastet. The sample dataset can be downloaded [here](https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/client_service/view?resource=https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu/data_service/00-TGbt6MLRm7VCn4mWmVaQsc).

We save masks per image as a json file. It can be loaded as a dictionary in python in the below format.

```python
{
    "image"                 : image_info,
    "annotations"           : [annotation],
}

image_info {
    "image_id"              : int,              # Image id
    "width"                 : int,              # Image width
    "height"                : int,              # Image height
    "file_name"             : str,              # Image filename
}

annotation {
    "id"                    : int,              # Annotation id
    "bbox"                  : [x, y, w, h],     # The box around the mask, in XYWH format
    "predicted_iou"         : float,            # The model's own prediction of the mask's quality
    "stability_score"       : float,            # A measure of the mask's quality
}
```

# Troubleshooting

Images contains EXT metadata rotations, this can affect the bounding box coordinates. 


# Run

python wildlifemapper/train_hydra.py model=vit_b batch_size=8 use_wandb=True
