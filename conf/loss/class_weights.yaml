# @package _global_
# Class weights configuration for wildlife detection
# Based on HerdNet configuration structure

# Class weights to handle class imbalance
# Weights are calculated using inverse frequency: max_count / class_count
# Index corresponds to: [species_1, species_2, species_3, species_4, species_5, species_6, background]
class_weights: [1.2, 1.9, 1.16, 6.37, 12.12, 1.0, 0.1]

# Class definition mapping (for reference)
class_names:
  1: "species_1"     # Class ID 1
  2: "species_2"     # Class ID 2
  3: "species_3"     # Class ID 3
  4: "species_4"     # Class ID 4
  5: "species_5"     # Class ID 5
  6: "species_6"     # Class ID 6
  # Background class is handled automatically in the loss function

# Weight rationale:
# - species_1 (1.2): Lower weight for common species
# - species_2 (1.9): Lower weight for more common species
# - species_3 (1.16): Slightly above uniform for moderately common species
# - species_4 (6.37): High weight due to lower frequency
# - species_5 (12.12): Highest weight due to rarity in dataset
# - species_6 (1.0): Uniform weight for balanced representation
# - background (0.1): Low weight to reduce false positive background predictions
