# @package _global_
# Class weights configuration for wildlife detection
# Based on HerdNet configuration structure

# Class weights to handle class imbalance
# Weights are calculated using inverse frequency: max_count / class_count
# Index corresponds to: [class_0, class_1, class_2, class_3, class_4, class_5, background]
# COCO category_ids 1-6 get converted to model classes 0-5, background is class 6
class_weights: [1.2, 1.9, 1.16, 6.37, 12.12, 1.0, 1.0]

# Class definition mapping (for reference)
class_names:
  0: "species_1"     # Converted from COCO category_id 1
  1: "species_2"     # Converted from COCO category_id 2
  2: "species_3"     # Converted from COCO category_id 3
  3: "species_4"     # Converted from COCO category_id 4
  4: "species_5"     # Converted from COCO category_id 5
  5: "species_6"     # Converted from COCO category_id 6
  # Background class 6 is handled automatically in the loss function

# Weight rationale:
# - category_0/species_1 (1.2): Lower weight for common species
# - category_1/species_2 (1.9): Lower weight for more common species
# - category_2/species_3 (1.16): Slightly above uniform for moderately common species
# - category_3/species_4 (6.37): High weight due to lower frequency
# - category_4/species_5 (12.12): Highest weight due to rarity in dataset
# - category_5/species_6 (1.0): Uniform weight for balanced representation
# - background (1.0): Balanced weight to prevent over-predicting background
