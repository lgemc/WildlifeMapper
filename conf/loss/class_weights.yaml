# @package _global_
# Class weights configuration for wildlife detection
# Based on HerdNet configuration structure

# Class weights to handle class imbalance
# Weights are calculated using inverse frequency: max_count / class_count
# Index corresponds to: [background, shoats, cattle, impala, zebra, wildebeest, buffalo, topi, other]
class_weights: [1.2,1.9,1.16,6.37,12.12,1.0,0.1]

# Class definition mapping (for reference)
class_names:
  0: "background"    # Special no-object class
  1: "topi"        # Class ID 1
  2: "buffalo"        # Class ID 2
  3: "kob"        # Class ID 3
  4: "warthog"         # Class ID 4
  5: "waterbuck"    # Class ID 5
  6: "elephant"       # Class ID 6
  # Class ID 9 is reserved for "no-object" background in the loss function

# Weight rationale:
# - background (0.1): Low weight to reduce false positive background predictions
# - wildebeest (12.12): Highest weight due to rarity in dataset
# - zebra (6.37): High weight due to lower frequency
# - other (3.0): Moderately high weight for miscellaneous species
# - topi (2.5): Moderate weight
# - cattle (1.9): Lower weight for more common species
# - shoats (1.2): Lower weight for common species
# - impala (1.16): Slightly above uniform for moderately common species
# - buffalo (1.0): Uniform weight for balanced representation
